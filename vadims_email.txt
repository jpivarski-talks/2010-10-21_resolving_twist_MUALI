Hi Jim,

I've made an ntuple and a bunch of various plots available at
http://hepr8.physics.tamu.edu/vadim/cms/mual/plots/tmp/2010-10-20/
individually or you can download all of them from

The main visible thing is that there are quite strong q/pt and q/pz dependencies. And it all also shows the importance of the use of robust statistical estimates. E.g., check out how dramatically the q/pt or q/pz profiles changes when moving from the mean based to the peak based estimation:

The + endcap has in general much better momentum dependence then th - endcap. E.g., compare

So it does seem like the B field in ME- has some issues.

Also, it looks like it might be better to use piece-vise linear function with two separate Q = +-1 regions to fit q/pt and, especially, q/pz.


For the separated by charge ring correction estimates, the sin&cos terms generally agree in statistical terms. However, the phiz corrections are often quite different. E.g.
